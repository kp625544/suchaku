#The SUCHAKU project

This is intended to be a complete Jarvis like bot based on Artificial Intelligence & Machine Learning and made on Python.
This project is to be completed in stages.

## Stage1:
   Things to be implemented:
          1.> Chatbot over lan
          2.> text to speech
          3.> Speech to text
          4.> Movement features for the robot
          5.> Automated Security Testing

#Stage2:
   Things to be implemented
         1.> Neural Networks 
         2.> Machine learning for chat 
         3.> Automation
         4.> Machine learning for Security testing

#Stage3:
   Things to be implemented 
         1.> To make an Operating System solely for the bot
